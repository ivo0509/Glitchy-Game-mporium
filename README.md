# Glitchy Game Emporium: A Bug-Hunting Playground 🕹️🐛

The "Glitchy Game Emporium" is a comprehensive, modern web application that simulates a digital video game storefront. It's built with a modern frontend stack (**React, TypeScript, Context API, Tailwind CSS**) but comes with a unique purpose: **it is intentionally and thoroughly broken.**

This project serves as a practical training ground for frontend and full-stack developers to practice their debugging skills in a complex, stateful application.

## The Challenge

Dive into the codebase as a new developer hired to fix a buggy product. Your goal is to identify, diagnose, and resolve the multitude of issues plaguing the store. The bugs range in complexity and type, providing a broad learning experience.

## Features (and what's wrong with them)

The application includes two primary user roles with a deep feature set:

#### 🧑‍💼 **Seller Dashboard**
*   **Game Management:** Add, edit, and remove games.
*   **Inventory & Suppliers:** Order stock from unreliable suppliers (watch for race conditions and off-by-one errors!).
*   **Employee Management:** Hire and fire staff, but beware of a payroll system that can't handle math (`NaN` errors).
*   **Analytics:** A dashboard with deeply flawed and inefficient data calculations.
*   **Seller Marketplace:** Trade inventory with other sellers, complete with broken filters and fake network errors.

#### 🎮 **Customer Dashboard**
*   **Game Store & Cart:** Browse and buy games, but the discount and VAT logic is... creative.
*   **Global Live Chat:** A real-time chat feature with a glaring Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Game Gifting & Trading:** Exchange games with other users, assuming the logic doesn't crash from a `TypeError` first.
*   **Wishlist & Reviews:** Manage your favorite games, but be careful of `null` values that can break the UI.
*   **Wallet & Daily Rewards:** Manage your funds and claim a daily reward from an easily exploitable system.

## Types of Bugs You'll Find

*   **Critical Errors:** `TypeError`, `ReferenceError` that crash components.
*   **State Management Bugs:** Direct state mutation, stale state, and race conditions.
*   **Logical Flaws:** Incorrect calculations (`NaN`), flawed business logic, and broken validation.
*   **Asynchronous Bugs:** Unresolved Promises, race conditions with `setTimeout`.
*   **Performance Issues:** Infinite loops, inefficient re-renders.
*   **UI/UX Glitches:** Unresponsive elements, garbled error messages (`[Object object]`).
*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** A classic stored XSS vulnerability in the chat.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React 18
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **State Management:** React Context API (used to demonstrate common state management issues)
*   **Build Tool:** Vite (in a typical setup)

Happy Bug Hunting!
